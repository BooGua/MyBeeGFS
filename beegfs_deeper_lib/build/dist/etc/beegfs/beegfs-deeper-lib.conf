#

# [sysCacheID]
# The ID of the used DEEP-ER BeeGFS cache.
# Default: <none>

# [sysMountPointCache]
# The mount point of the DEEP-ER BeeGFS cache.
# Default: <none>

# [sysMountPointGlobal]
# The mount point of the global BeeGFS storage.
# Default: <none>

# --- Section 3: [Advanced Settings Documentation] ---
#

#
# --- Section 3.3: [Connections & Communication] ---
#

# [connNamedSocket]
# The path to the named socket, which is used for the communication between the
# DEEP-ER cache API and the DEEP-ER cache daemon.
# Default: /var/run/beegfs-deeper-cached.sock

#
# --- Section 3.2: [Logging] ---
#

# [logType]
# Defines the logger type. This can either be "syslog" to send log messages to
# the general system logger or "logfile". If set to logfile logs will be written
# to logStdFile. 
# Default: logfile

# [logLevelLib]
# Defines the amount of output messages. The higher this level, the more 
# detailed the log messages will be.
# Note: This configuration is only for the shared library.
# Note: All log messages are logged to console (sterr). A log file is not
#       written.
# Note: Levels above 3 might decrease performance.
# Default: 0 (Max: 5)

# [logLevel]
# Defines the amount of output messages. The higher this level, the more 
# detailed the log messages will be.
# Note: This configuration is only for the cache daemon.
# Note: Levels above 3 might decrease performance.
# Default: 3 (Max: 5)

# [logNoDate]
# Defines whether "date & time" (=false) or the current "time only" (=true)
# should be logged.
# Note: This configuration is only for the cache daemon.
# Default: false 

# [logNumLines]
# The maximum number of lines per log file.
# Note: This configuration is only for the cache daemon.
# Default: 50000

# [logNumRotatedFiles]
# The number of old files to keep when "logNumLines" is reached and the log file
# is rewritten (log rotation).
# Note: This configuration is only for the cache daemon.
# Default: 5

# [logStdFile]
# The path and filename of the log file for standard log messages. 
# The parameter will be considered only if logType value is not equal to syslog.
# If no name is specified, the messages will be written to the console.
# Note: This configuration is only for the cache daemon.
# Default: /var/log/beegfs-deeper-cached.log

#
# --- Section 3.3: [Startup] ---
#

# [runDaemonized]
# Detach the process from its parent (and from stdin/-out/-err).
# Note: This configuration is only for the cache daemon.
# Default: true

#
# --- Section 3.4: [Tuning] ---
#

# [tuneFileSplitSize]
# The minimal file size before the file splited into multiple ranged prefetch
# or flush operations.
# Note: This configuration is only for the cache daemon.
# Default: 500m

# [tuneNumWorkers]
# The number of worker threads. A value of up to twice the number of CPU cores
# of your machine is the recommended choice.
# Note: This configuration is only for the cache daemon.
# Default: 32
